# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

A full-stack machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**, served through a **Flask API**, and visualized with a **React frontend**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete pipeline of an AI web application:
1. **Model Training (Python + TensorFlow)**  
   A CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.
2. **Backend (Flask API)**  
   The trained model is loaded and exposed via REST endpoints for predictions.
3. **Frontend (React)**  
   A simple web interface where users can draw digits and get predictions in real-time.
